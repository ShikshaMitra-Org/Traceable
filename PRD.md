## 1) Vision & One‑liner

**TRACEABLE** is an expert‑curated nutrition brand. We don’t make more supplements—we find the few that actually work. The site must feel premium, clinical, and confident, with minimal UI, generous white space, and verifiable proof behind every claim.

**Primary tagline:** *Curated by Experts. Traced to Source. Highest Qulaity*

**North‑star experience:** A visitor can (1) understand the problem, (2) grasp our 3 filters (Efficacy, Bioavailability, Traceability), (3) browse the curated 5–8, and (4) verify evidence/traceability (batch → COA → sourcing → peer‑reviewed citations) within 2 clicks.

**Non‑goal v1:** Full D2C checkout, account area, complex subscription management. (We may deep‑link to Amazon or a lightweight pre‑order/waitlist.)

## 2) Users & Jobs To Be Done

* **Health‑conscious skeptic**: “Cut the noise. Tell me what actually works and why.”
* **Time‑pressed professional**: “Give me the short list and the best form/dose—fast.”
* **Clinically minded buyer**: “Show me citations, COAs, and sourcing details I can trust.”

**Top JTBD:**

1. Understand what TRACEABLE is and why it’s different
2. See the curated set and pick the right one for me
3. Verify proof (studies, doses, forms, labs, suppliers)
4. Convert (buy now/waitlist) with confidence

## 3) Brand & Visual Direction (Minimal, Elegant)

* **Palette:** White base (#FFFFFF), Ink Black (#0B0B0C), Soft Graphite (#6A6A6A), Accents: Platinum (#EDEDED) and Rare‑Gold micro‑accents (#A08A5C) sparingly for premium cues.
* **Type:** Display: *Inter Tight* or *SF Pro Display* (tracking +0.2 to +0.3em on brand wordmark). Body: *Inter* / *Source Sans 3*. Line‑height 1.6–1.8. Generous letter‑spacing for “TRACEABLE”.
* **Spacing:** 8pt grid; card radii 16–20px; shadows ultra‑subtle.
* **Imagery:** Clean macro shots, lab textures, line illustrations—not stocky lifestyle.
* **Tone:** Confident, precise, non‑hype, evidence‑first.
